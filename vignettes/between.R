'between' lower= and upper= are both POSIXct but have different tzone attributes:

'between' arguments are all POSIXct but have mismatched tzone attributes:

trying to use integer64 class when 'bit64' package is not installed
Not yet implemented NAbounds=TRUE for this non-numeric and non-character type
Some lower>upper for this non-numeric and non-character type
RHS has length()

Perhaps you meant %s?
The first element should be the lower bound(s);
the second element should be the upper bound(s).
