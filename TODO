 - tools to ingest msgid and msgstr into a data.frame (remember: plurals)
 - tools to find un-translated msg in src
 - tools to find highly similar msg which might be templatable
 - tools to match quotations (a la matching \n)
 - tools to match punctuation
 - tools to find cat() output that's not gettext'd
 - initialize translations function -- should add a po.h header in src/, and *.po headers for some input languages (a separate function for initialize_language)
 - for updating messages -- `fuzzy`, `#~`, what the hell is this? Why not present an interactive version that doesn't require as much intimate knowledge of `xgettext` idiosyncrasies?
 - interactive prompt for translating messages (never need to touch a .po file)
