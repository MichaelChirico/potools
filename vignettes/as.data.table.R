as.data.table.array method should only be called for arrays with 3+ dimensions; use the matrix method for 2-dimensional arrays
Argument 'value.name' must be scalar character, non-NA and at least one character
Argument 'sorted' must be scalar logical and non-NA
Argument 'na.rm' must be scalar logical and non-NA
Please provide either 'key' or 'sorted', but not both.
Argument 'value.name' should not overlap with column names in result:
POSIXlt column type detected and converted to POSIXct. We do not recommend use of POSIXlt at all because it uses 40 bytes to store one date.
Item
has
rows but longest item has
; recycled with remainder.
A column may not be called .SD. That has special meaning.
class must be length 1
