Incompatible vector lengths: length(x)==%d length(lower)==%d length(upper)==%d. Each should be either length 1 or the length of the longest.
incbounds must be TRUE or FALSE
NAbounds must be TRUE or NA
check must be TRUE or FALSE
Item %d of lower (%d) is greater than item %d of upper (%d)
between parallel processing of integer took %8.3fs\n
x is integer64 but lower and/or upper are not.
Item %d of lower (%<PRId64>) is greater than item %d of upper (%<PRId64>)
between parallel processing of integer64 took %8.3fs\n
x is not integer64 but lower and/or upper is integer64. Please align classes.
Item %d of lower (%f) is greater than item %d of upper (%f)
between parallel processing of double with open bounds took %8.3fs\n
between parallel processing of double with closed bounds took %8.3fs\n
Item %d of lower ('%s') is greater than item %d of upper ('%s')
between non-parallel processing of character took %8.3fs\n
Internal error: between.c unsupported type '%s' should have been caught at R level
