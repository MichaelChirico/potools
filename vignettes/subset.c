Internal error: subsetVectorRaw length(ans)==%d n=%d
Internal error: column type '%s' not supported by data.table subset. All known types are supported so please report as bug.
Internal error. 'idx' is type '%s' not 'integer'
Internal error. 'idx' is type '%s' not 'integer'
Internal error. 'maxArg' is type '%s' and length %d, should be an integer singleton
Internal error: allowOverMax must be TRUE/FALSE
Internal error. max is %d, must be >= 0.
i[%d] is %d which is out of range [1,nrow=%d]
Item %d of i is %d and item %d is %d. Cannot mix positives and negatives.
Item %d of i is %d and item %d is NA. Cannot mix negatives and NA.
Item %d of i is %d but there are only %d rows. Ignoring this and %d more like it out of %d.
Item %d of i is %d which removes that item but that has occurred before. Ignoring this dup and %d other dups.
Column %d is NULL; malformed data.table.
Column %d ['%s'] is a data.frame or data.table; malformed data.table.
Column %d ['%s'] is length %d but column 1 is length %d; malformed data.table.
Internal error. Argument 'x' to CsubsetDT is type '%s' not 'list'
Internal error. Argument 'cols' to Csubset is type '%s' not 'integer'
Item %d of 'cols' is %d which is outside 1-based range [1,ncol(x)=%d]
Internal error: NULL can not be subset. It is invalid for a data.table to contain a NULL column.
Internal error: CsubsetVector is internal-use-only but has received negatives, zeros or out-of-range
