x must be of type numeric or logical, or a list, data.frame or data.table of such
n must be non 0 length
adaptive must be TRUE or FALSE
n must be integer, list is accepted for adaptive TRUE
n must be integer
n must be positive integer values (> 0)
n must be integer vector or list of integer vectors
n must be integer vector or list of integer vectors
na.rm must be TRUE or FALSE
hasNA must be TRUE, FALSE or NA
using hasNA FALSE and na.rm TRUE does not make sense, if you know there are NA values use hasNA TRUE, otherwise leave it as default NA
Internal error: invalid align argument in rolling function, should have been caught before. please report to data.table issue tracker.
using adaptive TRUE and align argument different than 'right' is not implemented
%s: allocating memory for results %dx%d\n
adaptive rolling function can only process 'x' having equal length of elements, like data.table or data.frame; If you want to call rolling function on list having variable length of elements call it for each field separately
length of integer vector(s) provided as list to 'n' argument must be equal to number of observations provided in 'x'
Internal error: invalid fun argument in rolling function, should have been caught before. please report to data.table issue tracker.
fill must be a vector of length 1
fill must be numeric or logical
Internal error: invalid algo argument in rolling function, should have been caught before. please report to data.table issue tracker.
