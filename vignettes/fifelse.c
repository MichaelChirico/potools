Argument 'test' must be logical.
S4 class objects (except nanotime) are not supported.
Length of 'yes' is %<PRId64> but must be 1 or length of 'test' (%<PRId64>).
Length of 'no' is %<PRId64> but must be 1 or length of 'test' (%<PRId64>).
Length of 'na' is %<PRId64> but must be 1 or length of 'test' (%<PRId64>).
'no' is of type %s but '%s' is %s. Please make all arguments have the same type.
'na' is of type %s but '%s' is %s. Please make all arguments have the same type.
'yes' has different class than 'no'. Please make sure that both arguments have the same class.
'yes' has different class than 'na'. Please make sure that both arguments have the same class.
'no' has different class than 'na'. Please make sure that both arguments have the same class.
'yes' and 'no' are both type factor but their levels are different.
'yes' and 'na' are both type factor but their levels are different.
'no' and 'na' are both type factor but their levels are different.
Type %s is not supported.
Received %d inputs; please supply an even number of arguments in ..., consisting of logical condition, resulting value pairs (in that order). Note that the default argument must be named explicitly, e.g., default=0
S4 class objects (except nanotime) are not supported. Please see https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4131.
Length of 'default' must be 1.
Resulting value is of type %s but 'default' is of type %s. Please make sure that both arguments have the same type.
Resulting value has different class than 'default'. Please make sure that both arguments have the same class.
Resulting value and 'default' are both type factor but their levels are different.
S4 class objects (except nanotime) are not supported. Please see https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/4131.
Argument #%d must be logical.
Argument #%d has a different length than argument #1. Please make sure all logical conditions have the same length.
Argument #%d is of type %s, however argument #2 is of type %s. Please make sure all output values have the same type.
Argument #%d has different class than argument #2, Please make sure all output values have the same class.
Argument #2 and argument #%d are both factor but their levels are different.
Length of output value #%d must either be 1 or length of logical condition.
Type %s is not supported.
